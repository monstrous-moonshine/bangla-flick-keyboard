# bangla-flick-keyboard
Bangla Flick Keyboard is a flick-style IME for Android (no iOS version right now, sadly). If you're wondering what a flick-style keyboard is,
it looks like this:

Notice that the letters are arranged in groups of 5, each group belonging to a key which are themselves arranged in a nice rectangular pattern.
If you need the letter in the middle of a key, you just press that key. But if you need a letter on one of the four sides -- left, top, right,
or bottom -- you have two options. You can keep pressing the same key in succession to cycle through all the letters belonging to that key. Or,
you can press some key and, without releasing your finger yet, flick your finger towards the desired letter.

Now, this works nicely for Japanese because the letters are naturally arranged in groups of five. For example, the first row in the Japanese
alphabet has the 5 letters a, i, u, e, and o. Later rows follow a similar pattern, for example -- ka, ki, ku, ke, ko, and so on. These rows can
naturally be grouped into single keys in the keyboard.

The idea behind Bangla Flick Keyboard is that the same idea works for Bangla too, for exactly the same reason -- the letters are arranged in groups
of five. Or, at least, the consonants are. Of course, the two languages are quite different, and each has to be adapted differently for this
keyboard layout, but the idea works surprisingly smoothly for Bangla too.

The project is a work in progress. I will update this page as I keep adding more features, or make other changes. Do come back from time to time! :-)
